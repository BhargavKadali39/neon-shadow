# neon-shadow
neon shadow for any frame or box with corresponding border like style and animation included.

Hands-on trial available on my [vercel deployed site](https://neon-shadow.vercel.app/) and at [codepen](https://codepen.io/bhargavkadali39/pen/jOLQopK)

NOTE: For mobile users landscape is preferred while viewing if any error occurs in vercel deployed site..

        @property --rotate {
          syntax: "<angle>";
          initial-value: 132deg;
          inherits: false;
          }
          
The above snippet is a experimental piece and I recommends using the codepen link which is given above and check if the final project isn't supported by your browser.
